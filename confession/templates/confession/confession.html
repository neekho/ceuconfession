    must be included everytime we are making a POST request, For example, 
    an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that submits 
    a form to change the user's email address or password on a different 
    site where the user is authenticated. -->

    <!-- The CSRF token is unique for each user and each session. It is generated by Django and associated with the user's session.
      When the form is submitted, the browser includes the CSRF token in the POST data.
      On the server side, Django checks if the submitted token matches the expected value for that user and session. 
      If they match, the request is considered valid; 
      otherwise, it may be rejected as a potential CSRF attack.
